A test of an OpenGL abstaction library idea for Rust.

Please don't expect this to become anything usable. I am using this as I learn to use OpenGL on my own, now that I have completed 30 or so ThinMatrix tutorials. I hope to use this as a foundation for some 3D noise worldgen in the future, but I don't think it will be generally useful. Hopefully it is inspiring though!
